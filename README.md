# C++ and QT Creator test repository
The code solves a Poisson equation with bc's and right hand side prescribed through a simple user interface
written in QT Creator. 

### Note 

* For now, only essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions are considered.
* 
* P

### Todo 
1. 
2. Add polynomial boundary conditions as well
3. Add Neumann boundary conditions
4. Insert plot into background picture instead of using Python plotter
